- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @circulwyrd 

I'm working on some geometry software adapted from CaR (Compass and Ruler, by Rene Grothmann, aka ZuL for Zirkel und Lineal).
No repository yet, will create when ready. I am actually working much more actively on a PDF project for publishing combinations
of sheet music (also playable on the computer via JFugue), text interleaved in multiple ways with cutouts for automatically 
scaled and positioned images and using custom embedded fonts, and with autogenerated indexing and table of contents that I will 
be combining with the geometry software into a single project.

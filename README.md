- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @circulwyrd
I'm working on some geometry software adapted from CaR (compass and ruler, by Rene Grothmann, aka ZuL for Zirkel und Lineal).
No repository yet, will create when ready. 
I'm also interested in creating my own fixed width font, starting with the fixed width F25_BlackletterTypewriter, and adding 
a few extra symbols as well as mostly math characters.
Other than that, I'm retired and my hobbies are many, but I am working on a creative project trying to unify most of them.
